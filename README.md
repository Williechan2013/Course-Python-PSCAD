Hi Everyone, 

My name is Jhair Acosta and I am PhD. candidate in Electrical Engineering at University of Campinas.

The propose of this course is to teach you how to use the Python automation library to automate PSCAD. The first eleven topics are introductories to Pyhton, so if you feel confident with Python programming language you can directly go to the topic twelve, which presents the actual Python automation. As bonus, I included how to use parallel computing on PSCAD controlled by the automation library.

I hope that this course will be usefull in your carrers. It was done in [Jupyther notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) because it is easy to present text and code in the same place. You can use other IDE if you feel more conftrable.
